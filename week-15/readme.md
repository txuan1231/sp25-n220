## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project will about the different implementations of Native America tribes with their respective license plates. It will show and display various different native american tribes with their history. Through clicking on the various displays of license plates, a user will be able to see this information. It will also go into the story by which various tribes got their license plates through history.

### Core Webpages

The various webpages will display the various tribes that were involved, this will include but will not be limited to the following tribes: Comanche, Ojibwe, Chippewa, Lenape, Menominee, and Mniwakan Oyate tribes.

### Design Choices

I will reference the pictures took for the field trip at the Eiteljorg Museum. I will reference the various Wikipedia page sources involved with the tribes. I will try to also use inspirations such as Amazon.com and Apple.com to style the various tribes' information. I will also differ from these examples by using more grounded nature-based colors to better identify with the tribes involved on the website.
