## Assignment 4



### Weekly Recap

Learned many different way to manipulate loops (for and while) to manipulate lists of numbers or items.  There seems to be only one major type of loop that mainly utilize for most things.  We also learned how manipulate how items appear on the DOM and how different items of a website appear on the website itself.  You can run many things just in console, and have the result of what you need be on screen on the website.  I found this to be very fascinating.
