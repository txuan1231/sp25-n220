## Homework 2

### Weekly Recap

For creating your html and js files on your Github, you must have a couple of different things set.  One thing you must have set is your Github repository to have the pages function give you a URL.  Once that url is set, then you can link to it in your code.  You must then have an inline and external script file.

Some shortcuts include ! , script , h1.  You use these and then press the Enter button.

Once you have your js and html files complete and formatted correctly, you must then create readme as per normal.
